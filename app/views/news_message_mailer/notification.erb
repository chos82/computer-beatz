There is a new message in the computer-beatz group '<%= @group.title %>'. 
To view the news of this group visit the following link:

<%= "http://#{SITE_URL}" + group_path(@group) %>


In case you don`t want to recieve notification e-mails, when someone writes to '<%= @group.title %>', you can change that behaviour by editing your membership at:

	<%= "http://#{SITE_URL}" + edit_group_member_path(@group, @member) %>
