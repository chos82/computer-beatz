computer-beatz is a social music platform and weblabel application.
It includes user user pages, messaging and news groups;
a music db with embedding of youtube videos and tagging;
music upload (royalty free music), commenting, etc.

As there was little usage, I took it from the web when 
the General Data Protection Regulation came up (it would 
have taken too much effort to get the site in compliance).
